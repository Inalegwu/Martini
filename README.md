*The best way to create NestJS apps powered by graphql*


Couple the best (not necessarily fastest) tech to build
your backends on Node


#### What's it made of ?

- [Prisma](https://prisma.io) : Well this project was originally meant to contain drizzle but turns out using drizzle in this pattern is quite complicated, But I'll get there soon

- [NestJS](https://nestjs.com) : The NodeJS framework for backend applications.I quite enjoy this, coming from a spring background in my early days of learning, It comes quite naturally to me

- [Apollo Graphql](https://): Our graphql server handler,I'm sure we all know or have heard of apollo.It's just nicely wrapped up in the ```@nestjs/graphql``` package so it plays well.
